# Icon

Icons are visual symbols for communicating additional
meaning, status, and available actions.

<ComponentPreview
  allowScrolling
  componentName="icons--gallery"
  maxWidth="100%"
  maxHeight="1000px"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Icon Example"
/>

### Usage

Icons can be used to provide meaning and bring visual
interest to elements of a page. They can also be used to
indicate available actions and to clarify status or
give feedback.

### Guidelines

- Icons should only be sized to `16px`, `24px`, or `32px`.
- Icons should not be used in place of artwork or illustrations.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Accessibility

The following guidance is based on the W3C guidelines and universal 
accessibility best practices:  

- Ensure all informative `<img>` elements have a meaningful alternate (ALT) 
text and all decorative `<img>` elements have empty alt attributes `(e.g. alt="")`. 
- There are three main ways to add alternate text to an image: 
  - Using an alt attribute. Example: `<img alt="drawing of a cat" src="...">`
  - Using an aria-label. Example: `<img aria-label="drawing of a cat" src="...">`
  - Using an aria-labelledby attribute. Example: `<img arialabelledby="someID" src="...">`

- Alt text should give the intent, purpose, and meaning of the image. 

- When writing the alternative text for an informative image always 
consider how the user will experience it based upon context of the entire page. 

- When writing the alternative text for a functional/active image 
(such as clickable icons or buttons), make sure that it helps your users understand what happens when they click the image. 

- Length 
  - 125 characters or less. 
  - Be as concise as possible while providing meaningful descriptions. 
  - Don’t include phrases like “image of” or “picture of.” 
  - Don’t include copyright or source information. 
  - Alternative text will innately improve the discoverability of your page. 
However, always remember that the purpose of ALT text is to provide accessibility 
for disabled users. (For example, it will empower your blind users to experience 
the image through the use of assistive technology, such as screen readers). 
Hence, you should never use ALT text as a SEO opportunity. 
You can include keywords only if they help describe the image. 

- Style
  - Use sentence case. 
  - Include a period at the end of the alt text – even if it’s not a 
complete sentence. The period will provide a slight pause when 
read by the screen reader. 

- Diversity & Inclusion
  - Always remember that your alternative text must be aligned with 
the culture of Diversity & Inclusion. Reflective of our ISMs 
and values, the ALT text should support and celebrate diversity 
across all its aspects, including and not limited to race, 
culture, disability, age, religion, gender, orientation, and 
other aspects of human identity we always embrace and empower 
through our words and actions.
